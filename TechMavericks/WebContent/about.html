		 <h3>What expense management does?</h3>
 <p>
Employee Expense Management automates all employee-based financial processes in a single, consolidated solution, and offers effective reporting and auditing.<br /><br /> <br/>

Expense Management allows even complex, multinational organizations to automate expense-related business processes and enforce policy compliance, reducing associated administrative costs and decreasing the opportunity for accidental error and intentional fraud. .<br /><br /> 
<br/>
Expense management system provides you with:<br/><br/>

    Voucher Reports—  Web-based automated system dramatically reduces the hassle, time, and cost of creating, approving, and processing expense reports, and offers the visibility and control necessary to comply with today's accounting standards.
    <br/><br/>Timesheets— Accurate recording of salaries is vital for timely customer billing and payroll calculation. Yet, this simple function is typically manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Timesheets simplifies the process by letting employees accurately report project hours as well as general work and absence hours, in a fraction of the time required by traditional paper-based methods. Quicker processing times and fewer errors lead to more efficient customer billing cycles and a reduction in days sales outstanding, contributing directly to the bottom line.
   <br/><br/> Digital receipt management— Employees can easily attach, email, or fax receipts for a paperless solution.
