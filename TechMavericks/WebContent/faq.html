        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
 <p>
 <h3>What is a travel and expense system?</h3>


A travel and expense system is a software tool that automates and centralizes many of the processes an organization uses to make travel arrangements as well as track, manage, and reconcile its expenses. In the University’s case, these expenses include travel, hosting, P-Card, and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. Many organizations also use travel and expense systems to significantly reduce turnaround times for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, improve compliance, and generate more detailed reports about expenditures.
<br/><br/>
 
 <h3>What is Concur? </h3>


Concur is the brand name of a travel and expense system. Concur, which has been in business since 1993, is used by thousands of organizations of all sizes around the world and has millions of users.

<br /><br /> 
<h3>What will I use Concur for?</h3>
 

Concur will be used for tracking and reconciling employee travel, hosting, P-Card (travel and non-travel), and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. It can also be used to make travel arrangements (book airfare, hotel accommodations, car rental, etc.)

 <br/><br/>
 <h3> Will P-Card holders still receive email messages regarding unsubmitted expenses?</h3>

Yes, Procurement Services will continue to monitor this, and will send messages to P-Card holders who do not work P-Card transactions for the P-Card cycle.

 <br/><br/>
 
 
 <h3>Does Concur check for a duplicate ticket number?
</h3>
 
There is an audit rule (TICKDUPL) that is activated at entry submit.  It checks to see if the expense type is travel airfare and the ticket number is not blank and if the value of “duplicate ticket number” is greater than 0. Note that this audit rule was not active for a time period, but has since been resolved.  Procurement is in the process of identifying any potential duplicates that may have been missed when the audit rule was not firing, and will pursue all duplicate reimbursements where identified from this research

<h3> If the system is all electronic, how do I submit my receipts?
</h3>
 

You will “attach” receipts electronically to your expense report by either faxing them to a dedicated fax line directly into Concur, or by uploading scanned images of the receipts directly to the Concur system. The receipts are viewable in the system generally within 15 minutes of fax/upload.

<br/><br/>
<h3> Who is my expense approver in Concur?</h3>

Your department/unit will determine who the appropriate default approver is for your expense reports, as part of their unit readiness in moving to Concur.


 <br/><br/>
 <h3>Can I tell if I'm an approver on someone's expense report?</h3>


No, not until you receive the email notification that you have a report to approve.



 <br/><br/>
 <h3>Why does an approved expense report come off the “Reports you Approved this Month, Quarter, Year“ list when a report is returned to the employee? </h3>



Approvers do not have access to reports which are sent back to the employee for modification, until the employee resubmits the report back through the appropriate approval workflow.  This is because approvers do not have access to expense reports which are still “a work in process” that have not been submitted into the approval workflow.  Approvers only have access to reports that have been submitted for their approval, or which they have approved and the report is still in the work flow chain or has been approved and submitted for payment.  It should be noted that the expense report should be routed back through all of the appropriate unit-defined approvers after making updates to a returned report (i.e., it should not be sent back to just the one approver that sent the report back if other approvers were initially involved).  The audit trail of an expense report can be viewed by the approver when they are reviewing an expense report to view previous steps completed for the report (i.e., was the report previously approved and/or returned to the employee).  After the expense report has been approved and extracted for payment, information can be found about the report and who approved it by using reports available in the data warehouse. The “Unsubmitted Expense Reports” report (sent monthly by Procurement Services to those with the Department Manager role in M-Pathways) can be used to identify reports which have been created but not submitted for approval.
